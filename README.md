# AstroDog
## Inspiration
The UGA mascot inspired us to create a game around him. The theme of hardware lead us to create a game that uses hardware to manipulate the environment, rather than the character, to traverse throughout the level.
## What it does
Using cannons and cranes manipulated by joysticks, knobs, and buttons, the player has to traverse through maps in outer space. The console also allows the player to view the power level for certain mechanics on a 16x2 display, as well as a dot matrix which points in the direction of the next checkpoint.
## How we built it
The game was built using Unity and C#, with assets crated in Photoshop and on [Pixelart](pixelart.com). Much of the collaboration was done using Github, Google Drive and Discord.
## Challenges we ran into
As Unity beginners, it was difficult for us to interface the hardware and set it up to work with our Unity scripts.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our artwork and handmade assets. Our entire game, aside from the music, was built from scratch, and made with love.
## What we learned
We learned a ton about using Unity and managing various objects and assets in the scope of our game. Additionally, we gained insight about setting up hardware in conjunction with Unity for an experience detached from a mouse and keyboard.
## What's next for AstroDog
Since our game is setup with a level-by-level scheme, we look forward to further exploring the fantasy of a good dog exploring space with new levels, assets, and tools.
